## Week 1 Summary (09/29/2025)

### This week I worked on:

This week I worked on creating a schedule for which tasks I plan to accomplish each week this semester. The goal of having this plan is to help me stay on schedule for the tasks I plan to accomplish each week.I also created my empty project in Unreal Engine and imported several large asset packs that I can use to begin creating the first enviroment for my game. Creating the environment for the first few quests in my game is my main objective for weeks 2 and 3.  

### This week I learned:

This week, most of my work involved processes I am alredy familiar with. I did change a few graphical settings in Unreal when setting up my project that were new to me. These changed were to lower the graphical quality and lighting presets so my PC doesn't sound like a steam engine each time I go to open my project.

### My successes this week were:

This week, I managed to find a few more assets to use for my first enviroment that I planned. Finding optimized game assets for free can be challenging, so I am pleased with my progress there.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

I have been struggling to estimate how long tasks will take me, which makes it difficult to create my weekly sprints. I am also trying to write quests for the gameplay, which has been more challenging than I realized it would be. It is one thing to write a plot, but if it's boring, it defeats rhe entire purpose.
